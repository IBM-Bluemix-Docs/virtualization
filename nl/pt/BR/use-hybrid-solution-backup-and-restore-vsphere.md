<!--Data backup is currently the most trusted means of maintaining safety, integrity, and redundancy. However, as the amount of backed up data increases, so does the amount of space needed to store it. In the past, storing backups on high-performance storage or tape were feasible solutions. Today, enterprises are seeking to alleviate the capital and operational costs associated with physical on-premises storage by augmenting or even replacing it with Object Storage.-->
