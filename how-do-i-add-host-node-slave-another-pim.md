# Adding a host node in PIM

Complete the following steps to add a host node as a slave of another in PIM:

1. On the server that you designated as the Master, go to **Infrastructure > Hardware Nodes > New Hardware Node**.
2. Enter the IP address/username(root)/password of the remote hardware node and register.

The new node resources are not immediately updated in the Master PIM.
