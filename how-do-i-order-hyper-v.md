If you have an existing server, you can install Hyper-V on a server by initiating an OS reload and by changing the operating system to `Windows Server Datacenter Edition with Hyper-V`.

If you want to provision a server by using Hyper-V, place an order for the new server and select `Windows Server Datacenter Edition with Hyper-V‚Äù as the operating system`.
