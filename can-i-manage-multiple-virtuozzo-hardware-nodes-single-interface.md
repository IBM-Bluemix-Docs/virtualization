# Managing multiple Virtuozzo hardware nodes through a single interface
{: #managing-multiple-virtuozzo-hardware-nodes-through-a-single-interface}

Managing multiple nodes is done through the PIM interface. You use PIM to have a controller server with multiple workers. A worker is managed by only a single controller. It cannot be a part of alternative groups that are managed by a separate controller.

Follow these steps to manage multiple hardware nodes:

1. Go to **Infrastructure**.
2. In the second tab, click **Hardware Nodes > New Hardware Node**
3. Click **Register**.

You can now manage both the controller and the worker through the same PIM interface.
