# FAQs: Veeam Backup & Replication

## Can I add additional license packs to my Veeam server?

Yes. If you need to add additional license packs to your Veeam Backup and Replication server simply open a sales ticket to start the process.

## Can I add Veeam Backup and Replication to my existing server?

Unfortunately it is not possible to add the Veeam Backup and Replication application to an existing server. You would need to either order 
Veeam when creating the server or issue an OS Reload and add the Veeam Backup and Replication offering during the reload process.
