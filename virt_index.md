# Getting started with Virtualization

The Virtualization solution allows you to run multiple virtual machines in a single dedicated environment. Virtual machines run on the {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_full}} Network have the ability to integrate with other physical and virtual devices on the network and can be managed through both the Customer Portal and API. Running virtual machines on the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} proprietary architecture and automated platform offers high levels of stability suitable for enterprise-class virtualization, as well as virtualization on a smaller scale.

| Get Started       |
|:------------------|
| __ 1. Learn about virtualization options: [Citrix XenServer](what-citrix-xenserver.html), [Hyper-V](what-hyper-v.html), [Virtuozzo](what-virtuozzo.html), and [VMware](/docs/infrastructure/vmware/vmware_index.html). |
| __ 2. [Set up a hypervisor](set-up-a-hypervisor.html). ([Setting up a Virtual Machine Network](virtual-machine-network-setup.html) is an important part of this process.) |
| __ 3. Depending on which virtualization solutions that you are using, you can [Set up Hyper-V](hyper-v-setup.html), [Get started with Virtuozzo](getting-started-with-virtuozzo.html), [Get Started with VMware vSphere 6](/docs/infrastructure/vmware/vmware-vsphere-6-getting-started.html), or [Install XenServer Tools](how-install-xenserver-tools-linux.html). |
