# What is Citrix XenServer?

XenServer is a server virtualization platform that offers near bare metal virtualization performance for virtualized server and client operating systems.

XenServer uses the Xen hypervisor to virtualize each server, on which it is installed, enabling each to host multiple virtual machines simultaneously with great performance. You can also use XenServer to combine multiple Xen-enabled servers into a powerful resource pool, by using industry-standard shared storage architectures and by using resource clustering. In doing so, XenServer extends the basic single-server notion of virtualization to enable seamless virtualization of multiple servers as a resource pool, whose storage, memory, CPU, and networking resources can be dynamically controlled to deliver optimal performance, increased resiliency and availability, and maximum use of data center resources.

IT managers can use XenServer to create multiple clusters of resource pools and manage the clusters and their resources from a single point of control. <!--reducing complexity and cost, and dramatically simplifying the adoption and utility of a virtualized data center environment.--> With XenServer, a rack of servers can become a highly available compute cluster that protects key application workloads by using industry standard storage architectures. XenServer also offers no-downtime maintenance by moving virtual machines while they are running between machines in the cluster. XenServer extends the most powerful abstraction: virtualization across servers, storage, and networking to enable users to realize the full potential of a dynamic, responsive, efficient data center environment for Windows and Linux workloads.
